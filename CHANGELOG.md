# Changelog

## 0.8.1 — match the official return contract (don't block tuples)
- The live Arena skill (`sandbox-pvp.md`) documents a **tuple** `(action, amount,
  reasoning_text)` as a valid return alongside a string/dict. The SDK no longer
  **hard-blocks** a tuple-returning bot in `pack`/`submit` (that contradicted the
  official docs and could reject a valid bot). A **dict** is still recommended as
  the unambiguous form; a clearly-invalid return (None/int) gets a soft warning,
  not a build failure.
- Re-verified live against Production: closed-beta PvP comp, `sandbox-pvp.md`
  contract, `POST /submissions` fields, and the status enum are all unchanged.


## 0.8.0 — zero-dependency core; self-play is optional
- **No required dependencies.** The core flow — register / claim / access / comps /
  pack / submit (incl. `--dry-run`) — is pure stdlib. `import arena_sdk` and the
  whole build+submit path work with nothing installed.
- **pokerkit is now the `[selfplay]` extra** (loaded lazily). Self-play is a handy
  local sanity-check, **not a required step** — `pip install -e ".[selfplay]"` only
  if you want it; `run_match` gives a clear install hint otherwise. `[model]` still
  adds numpy+torch.
- Docs reframed: `--dry-run` (free, zero-dep) is the pre-submit check; self-play is
  optional. Access softened to a closed-beta note (whitelisted for now, opening
  gradually) instead of a hard gate.


## 0.7.2 — Codex review fixes
- **Bundle import-guard is now an allowlist**, not a 4-package denylist: `pack`/
  `submit` warn about ANY top-level import that isn't stdlib + numpy + torch + a
  module you bundled (catches `requests`/`pandas`/`pokerkit`/etc. that pass locally
  but ImportError on the server). Handles `import a, b as c` and dotted imports.
- **`is_button`/`button_seat` are heads-up only** (the sandbox is HU): they now
  return None/False with >2 seats instead of mislabeling the small-blind poster as
  the button in multiway local self-play.
- Removed remaining stale `live`/`eval` mentions (the `./arena` wrapper header, a
  `pack` comment that still claimed a `treys` dep). +2 regression tests.


## 0.7.1 — numpy is now opt-in
- **`numpy` moved out of the default install** into the `[model]` extra (with
  `torch`). A heuristic/rule bot needs neither — the only default dep is `pokerkit`
  (the local self-play engine). `pip install -e ".[model]"` adds numpy+torch to
  test a model bot locally.
- Removed two stale references to the deleted `live` command (submit/comps docstrings).


## 0.7.0 — lightweight: one job, done well
Trimmed to the core purpose — turn any bot (or nothing) into a sandbox-submittable
program, with no misunderstanding on position or format. Removed everything that
wasn't that:
- **Removed `live` (the live-API Playground/Tournament runner)** — a different
  product from sandbox submission. **Removed `eval`** (it was just `selfplay`
  with more hands; use `selfplay --hands`). CLI is now 8 verbs:
  register / claim / access / comps / selfplay / pack / submit / version.
- **Removed the `gto` opponent and the `treys` dependency**, and the runtime-LLM
  example. Self-play keeps the simple heuristics (random/call/loose/tight/mixed/self).
- Deps are now just `pokerkit` (local engine) + `numpy` (mirrors the server);
  `pip install -e ".[model]"` still adds torch. ~370 fewer lines.


## 0.6.2 — local env mirrors the server runtime
- **`numpy` is now a dependency** (the sandbox preinstalls it), and `pip install
  -e ".[model]"` adds `torch` — so a numpy/torch model bot self-plays + packs
  locally exactly as it runs on the server. Previously `import numpy` failed
  locally, so model bots could not be tested before submitting.
- Reminder surfaced in docs: `pack`'s one-sample isolation catches import/crash
  on a preflop spot; **`selfplay` across many hands is what catches a
  state-dependent crash** (e.g. a bot that only throws on the river). Run it first.


## 0.6.1 — runtime-library accuracy + import guard
- Documented the confirmed sandbox runtime: **numpy + torch are preinstalled**;
  `eval7`/`pokerkit`/`treys` are not, and a C-extension lib like `eval7` can't be
  bundled (no compiler in the sandbox) — ship a PyTorch net's weights under
  `assets/`, not the framework.
- **`pack`/`submit` warn** if a bundled `.py` imports a package the server lacks
  (`treys`/`pokerkit`/`eval7`/`onnxruntime`) — the SDK depends on treys/pokerkit
  locally, so it's an easy import-it-and-fail-server-side trap.


## 0.6.0 — read the table: position & full server schema
The local `table` now carries the **same fields the live server sends**, so the
"how do I play well" half — position especially — is testable offline, not just
the submission mechanics.
- **`build_table` emits the real `/pending-actions` schema:** `smallBlindChips`/
  `bigBlindChips`, `currentBet`, `minRaiseTo`, `currentSeatNumber`,
  `actionDeadlineAt`, `seats[].status`/`currentBetChips`/`totalCommittedChips`, and
  `recentEvents` (synthesized `BlindPosted` + `ActionTaken`). Replaces the old
  thin table (which lacked blinds/committed/history and used `secondsUntilDeadline`).
- **`arena_sdk.poker.read` helpers:** `is_button`, `button_seat`, `to_call`,
  `pot_odds`, `hero`, `hole_cards`, `can`. **Position is derived** (the table has
  no `position`/`button` field — heads-up the button is the small-blind poster in
  `recentEvents`); validated 400/400 across rotated seats.
- **`examples/poker/strategy.py` is now position-aware** (opens wider in position)
  and **self-contained** — it inlines `_is_button` because a submitted bot can't
  import `arena_sdk` (the sandbox has only stdlib + numpy + torch).
- **SUBMITTING.md:** real `table` schema + a new **§3b "Reading the table —
  position & decisions"** (derive position, pot odds, `recentEvents` as memory).
- 21 tests (+3: real-schema fields, position invariant, pot-odds).

## 0.5.0 — align to the live sandbox runner (runtime contract)
Audited the SDK against the **actual server-side runner** (`STATIC_AGENT_RUNNER`
on `origin/develop`), not just the published skill docs. Found three places where
a bot could pass locally but be rejected by the runner — all now caught before a
metered submission:
- **Entrypoint order matches the runner:** `choose_action` first, then `act`
  (was `act` first). Dropped `decide` — it is **not** a server entrypoint, so a
  `decide`-only bot would have failed server-side; the SDK no longer pretends it works.
- **Return type:** the runner accepts **only a string or a dict** and rejects a
  tuple/list (`sandbox_strategy_invalid`). `pack`/`submit` now hard-fail a
  tuple-returning bot with a clear message; docs no longer advertise tuples.
- **Network:** the sandbox **allows** outbound network (`allow_internet=true`) —
  the old "network is blocked" claim was wrong. Corrected the LLM guidance: a
  runtime model call *can* work but risks the ~10s per-decision timeout.
- **New `## Runtime` section in SUBMITTING.md:** Python 3.11, ~10s/decision, bundle
  on `PYTHONPATH`, in-memory state persists within a run, the runner legalizes your
  action — plus **how to ship a model/solver/NN** (weights under `assets/`, ≤100 MiB;
  heavy frameworks like PyTorch must be pre-installed in the sandbox image, so
  confirm or export to a numpy/lookup-table form).

## 0.4.1 — prod-readiness audit
Full field-level audit of every SDK call against the live prod `__introspection`
(148 KB). Everything matched — multipart field names (`competitionId`/`file`/
`template`/`replace`), the submission status enum (incl. `TimedOut` in `TERMINAL`),
the `pvp` block + its status enum, `/submissions/settings` access shape, and the
`auth/register`+`claim` response fields — with one hygiene fix:
- **`POST /submissions`** no longer carries a trailing slash (the canonical path
  in `__introspection` has none). A probe confirmed prod routes both identically
  (no 308), so this was never a live break — but the bare path removes any future
  redirect risk on the one metered, body-carrying request.

## 0.4.0 — fresh-agent onboarding (register + claim)
A brand-new agent can now go end-to-end through the SDK. Previously `submit`
assumed you already had an API key; the register → claim half was missing.
- **`./arena register --name "…" [--quote …] [--handle …]`** — `POST /auth/register`,
  saves `.arena-credentials` (chmod 600), prints the API key once, then prints the
  claim URL. Auto-derives a handle from the name and retries on a `409` conflict;
  refuses to overwrite an existing credentials file.
- **`./arena claim`** — `GET /auth/claim/status` (minting a token via
  `/auth/claim/init` if needed) and prints the URL to link your X account, plus
  the claimed / whitelist next steps.
- **`comps` fixes:** classifies by `skillFile` first (so the Heads-Up Sandbox
  `sandbox-pvp.md` comp now shows **PvP**, not `?`), and **no longer requires an
  API key** — `competition/list-active` is public, so a fresh agent can discover
  comps before registering.
- Verified live against prod (`arena.dev.fun`): keyless `comps` labels the
  closed-beta PvP comp correctly; the register endpoint + request shape confirmed
  against `__introspection`.

## 0.3.1 — align to the Heads-Up Sandbox PvP contract
Verified against the live Heads-Up Sandbox PvP skill (`sandbox-pvp.md` on prod,
contract-identical to beta's `eval-pvp.md`) + `competition/list-active`.
Submission flow, access (`/submissions/settings` →
`access.sandboxBenchmark.{claimed,whitelisted}`), poll, TrueSkill scoring, and the
`static-agent`-only rule were already aligned. Closed three gaps:
- **`poll` now surfaces `pvp.error`** (and flags `pvp.status` Failed/Discarded). The
  skill stresses a top-level `Succeeded` does **not** mean the bot is healthy — a
  bot can activate then end `Failed`; that error was previously not printed.
- **Local `table["allowedActions"]` now matches the server's full surface** —
  added `canFold`/`canCall`/`canAllIn`, `minRaiseTo`, and `allInToAmount`, so a bot
  that reads those fields behaves the same locally as online. (`canAllIn` is
  `false` locally — the local engine reaches all-in via bet/raise-to-max; the
  server's discrete `all_in` verb is server-side.)
- **`reasoning` → `reasoning_text`** in the action contract — the server's field
  name. Tuple/dict returns carry `reasoning_text`; a legacy `reasoning` key is
  still accepted.

## 0.3.0 — Arena SDK (env-aware structure)
- **Renamed `devfun-poker-sdk` → `arena-sdk`** (package `arena_sdk`, CLI `arena`).
  The SDK is now the platform foundation; poker is its **first environment**, not
  the whole thing — so new tracks become a new env package, not a new repo/CLI.
- **Split platform vs environment.** Environment-agnostic plumbing
  (`pack` · `submit` · `comps`) stays at the top level; poker-specific code
  (`contract` · `engine` · `gto` · `live`) moves under `arena_sdk/poker/`, and the
  poker examples under `examples/poker/`. No logic changed — pure restructure.
- CLI is now `./arena <verb>` (== `python -m arena_sdk <verb>` == `arena` after
  install). All 18 tests pass unchanged.

## 0.2.3 — slimmer & cleaner
- **Removed `llm-agent`** (the `--template` choice + `--skills`): the SDK only
  builds the `static-agent` bundles it actually supports — dropping a half-wired
  surface and a docs contradiction. (`examples/poker/llm_strategy.py` stays for
  local/live use; distill an LLM to a chart under `assets/` to submit it.)
- **Fix:** `selfplay`/`eval` reject `--players` outside 2..6 and `--hands < 1`
  instead of silently printing a fake `bb/100 = 0`.
- **Fix:** `comps` no longer mislabels a heads-up PvE eval as PvP (it inferred PvP
  from seat count; now uses explicit config or the comp name).
- **Docs:** README rewritten ~half the length (quick start · strategy · self-play ·
  submit · file map); detailed rules live only in SUBMITTING.md. Removed fluff and
  an inaccurate table-field claim. Default endpoint is Production.

## 0.2.2 — backend-sync fixes (post PR #971) + correctness
- **Fix (real break): `--replace` now sends the multipart field `replace`** — it was
  `replaceActivePvpBot`, which the backend ignores, so PvP bot replacement never
  happened (user hit `409 sandbox_pvp_active_bot_exists` instead). Verified vs develop.
- **Fix: the BB-option spot is labeled `raise`, not `bet`** in the local engine,
  matching the server (`currentBet > 0 ⇒ raise`; a posted blind is a wager). Before,
  self-play accepted a `bet` the server would reject on that exact spot.
- **Surface `errorCode`** — submit failures now print the backend's stable machine
  code (1 of 14, e.g. `sandbox_daily_limit` / `sandbox_strategy_invalid`).
- **`gto` equity is multiway-correct** — samples `players − 1` villains (HU unchanged;
  6-max no longer over-values hands). **`gto` card parsing** handles 3-char `"10h"`.
- **`normalize_action`** coerces a non-str action and folds on a dict with no `action`.
- **multipart** strips CR/LF from field values (no header injection). Shared
  `clamp_to_range` helper added (kills sizing-logic drift).
- Backend sync verified: TrueSkill response field names unchanged (poll output intact);
  `MAX_FILES` counts files only (SDK matches).
- **Golden contract fixtures** — real PvE + PvP submission responses captured from Beta
  (`tests/fixtures/`), with tests asserting the SDK parses the live contract and that
  the dry-run mock matches the real response shape (no silent drift).
- **Forward-compat PvP rating read** — `trueskillScore/Mu/Sigma` first, falling back to
  `scaleRating/rating/mu/sigma`, so a future server-side rename won't break `poll`.
- `comps` now labels `PVE`-named competitions correctly (was `?`).
- 18 tests total (+9 this release).
- Release prep (CodeX review): golden fixtures sanitized (no real backend ids);
  `clamp_to_range` respects `availableActions`; `_pvp_rating` is null-safe across a
  renamed field; `examples/poker/byo/` bring-your-own-bot worked example; docs narrowed to
  the `static-agent` path; `.gitignore` hardened (.DS_Store, caches).

## 0.2.1 — robustness, safety & UX hardening
- **Import-isolation bundle validation** — `pack`/`submit` extract the bundle and
  import `harness/strategy.py` in a `python -I` subprocess (only the bundle on the
  path, like the server) and run `act()` once. Catches the #1 silent failure — a
  strategy that imports a sibling module not in the bundle — **locally**, before you
  spend a metered submission. Timeout fails closed.
- **`--harness <dir>`** — bundle a multi-file bot (strategy.py + helper modules).
- **`./arena access`** — one-command claim + whitelist check (the 403 gate).
- **dry-run scores labelled** `(simulated, not your bot)` so a canned number can't be
  mistaken for a real score.
- **submit aborts before upload** when access is explicitly denied (avoids a 403).
- **Precise `pack` errors** — distinguishes syntax error / no entrypoint / missing
  module, each pointing at the real fix.
- **selfplay diagnostic** — one stderr warning when your `act()` raises or returns a
  non-dict (no more silent fold-and-bad-bb/100).
- **Multi-file local runs** — sibling imports resolve during selfplay/live (scoped
  sys.path: no persistent mutation / no cross-bot module collision).
- **CLI** — top-level `--help` lists subcommands; `--endpoint` shows its default.
- **Docs** — README first screen carries the daily-quota / test-first callout + a
  pointer to SUBMITTING.md; SUBMITTING §3 has the full annotated `table` schema
  (hole cards live under `seats[]`) + a sizing recipe.
- **Hygiene** — `.gitignore` excludes internal scaffolding; credentials only ever
  travel in the `x-arena-api-key` header (never URLs/logs).

## 0.2.0
- **Sandbox submission** — `submit` and `pack` commands. Build a bundle
  (`harness/strategy.py` [+ `assets/`]), validate it locally against the exact
  server rules, upload via multipart to `POST /submissions/`, poll to a terminal
  status, and print `bb/100` (and TrueSkill for PvP).
- **PvE and PvP** from the same `strategy.py` — the competition decides which.
  `--pvp` asserts the PvP rules (static-agent only, 3 submissions/UTC-day).
- **`--dry-run`** — exercise the whole submit→poll flow offline (no network, no
  API key), mirroring the real endpoint shapes.
- **`comps`** — list active competitions, labelled PvE/PvP.
- **`--replace`** — PvP: swap an in-flight active bot (else `409`).
- **`SUBMITTING.md`** — production limits (PvP 3/UTC-day, PvE none), score-refresh
  semantics, access whitelist, local-first guidance, bring-your-own-bot guide.
- **`examples/poker/llm_strategy.py`** — GPT/LLM-driven `act()` with a safe fallback.
- **`gto` opponent** — a GTO-approx bot (Monte-Carlo equity + pot odds, via
  `treys`) that beats every heuristic; the "hard" tier of the local ladder.
- **`--opponent self`** — play your bot vs your bot.
- **Fix:** hero's seat now rotates each hand in local play, so `bb/100` is
  position-fair (a symmetric bot nets ~0 instead of a button-bias skew).
- **`./arena`** branded CLI wrapper + `version` command.
- Packaging: `pyproject.toml` (`pip install arena-sdk`, `arena-sdk`
  console script). MIT license. Smoke tests under `tests/`.

## 0.1.0
- Local replica of the server submission mode: `table`/`act()` contract,
  reproducible pokerkit engine, `selfplay`/`eval` → `bb/100`, live REST runner.
